                    <h2 class="hero-headline">You can't delegate this one.</h2>

                    <p>You've built a career on commissioning, briefing, steering. Handing technical stuff to people who know it better. Trusting managers to work out the how.</p>

                    <p>That won't work with AI.</p>

                    <p>When spreadsheets arrived, you could hire someone who knew Excel. AI is different. It's not a tool you hand to a specialist. It's a new language for leading — and you can only learn it by speaking it yourself.</p>

                    <p>The good news: you already know how to ask good questions. You brief executives and ministers, steer boards, challenge consultants. That's the core skill. AI just needs you to practise it in a new way — every day, on real problems, until it becomes instinct.</p>

                    <p>No course teaches this. No consultant can do it for you. The leaders pulling ahead aren't more technical. They're more disciplined about practising.</p>

                    <p class="hero-emphasis">Ten minutes a day. That's all it takes to start.</p>

                <h2>Find 10 minutes a day — and defend them</h2>

                <p>This is the hardest step. Not because AI is complicated, but because your diary is block-booked.</p>

                <p>You already know how to learn. You've picked up new skills throughout your career — often under pressure, often without formal training. AI is no different. What's different is that no one is going to give you time to do it.</p>

                <p>So take it.</p>

                <p>Block 10 minutes. Every day. Same time if you can. Treat it like a meeting you can't cancel — because for the next few months, it's the most important one you have.</p>

                <p>Why 10 minutes? Because it's short enough to actually happen. Long enough to try something real. And it compounds. Ten minutes a day for a month is five hours of practice. In six months, you'll have built a skill that most leaders are still delegating.</p>

                <p>If you're using the free version of ChatGPT, or waiting for IT to roll something out, you're not serious yet.</p>

                <p>This isn't about money — the best tools cost less than a newspaper subscription. It's about commitment. When you pay for your own account, you own the space. No one's watching your prompts. No one's judging your questions. You can experiment, fail, and learn.</p>

                <p>Get a paid subscription to Claude, ChatGPT, or Gemini. All three are good. Claude is particularly strong for writing and analysis. ChatGPT is the most widely used. Pick one and stick with it for a month before comparing.</p>

                <p>Don't wait for your organisation's enterprise solution. By the time it arrives, you'll have missed months of learning — and you'll be behind the people who just got on with it.</p>

                    <p>Public sector leaders — whether in central government, local authorities, the NHS, or arm's-length bodies — are using AI to summarise long documents for briefings to executives, ministers and elected members, draft options appraisals, and prepare speaking notes for committees. The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-playbook-for-the-uk-government" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UK government's AI Playbook</a> has examples of what's working.</p>

                    <p>The question isn't whether AI can do your job. It's whether you can direct it well enough to make your job easier — while keeping the accountability where it belongs.</p>

                    <p>Business leaders are using AI to draft investor updates, prepare for due diligence, build financial models from messy data, and turn meeting notes into action plans. The gains come from repetition — doing it once teaches you nothing, doing it daily changes how you work.</p>

                    <p>This is also how leaders are building internal tools without writing code — what's now called <a href="#vibe-coding" class="glossary-link">vibe coding</a>. You describe what you want, the AI builds it, you test and refine. It's not magic. It's a new way of working that rewards clear thinking over technical skill.</p>

                    <p>Founders are using AI to write cold outreach, draft investor updates, build MVPs without a technical co-founder, and turn customer calls into product requirements. Y Combinator reported that 25% of its Winter 2025 batch had codebases that were 95% AI-generated.</p>

                    <p>This is <a href="#vibe-coding" class="glossary-link">vibe coding</a> — describing what you want, letting AI build it, testing and refining. Collins Dictionary's word of the year 2025. It's not magic. It's a new way of working that rewards clear thinking over technical skill. And it means a founder today can go further on £500k than earlier generations did on £5m.</p>

                <p>You already know how to ask good questions. You brief executives, ministers and elected members, steer boards, challenge consultants. That's the core skill. AI just needs you to practise it in a new way.</p>

                <p>The better your <a href="#prompt" class="glossary-link">prompt</a>, the better the output. Be specific. Give context. Say what you want and what you don't want. If the first answer isn't right, don't start again — refine the question.</p>

                <h3>Think of it as a dialogue, not a search</h3>

                <p>The biggest mistake new users make is treating AI like Google — one question, one answer, done. That's not how it works. The real power comes from conversation.</p>

                <p>When you get a response, interrogate it. Ask "Why did you suggest that approach?" or "What are the risks with this?" or "Give me three alternatives." Push back. Ask for sources. Request it in a different format. Say "That's too long — give me the three most important points."</p>

                <p>You wouldn't accept the first draft from a junior colleague without questions. Don't accept it from AI either. The dialogue is where the value emerges — and where you learn what works.</p>

                <h3>Checking is the essential skill</h3>

                <p>AI will confidently present information that's wrong. It will invent sources. It will miss nuance. Your job is to check — not to trust. This is called <a href="#hallucination" class="glossary-link">hallucination</a>, and it happens more often than you'd expect.</p>

                <p>Build checking into your workflow. When AI gives you statistics, verify them. When it cites a report, find the original. When it makes a recommendation, ask yourself what it might have missed. This isn't busywork — it's the difference between using AI well and being embarrassed by it.</p>

                <p>This is the skill that separates useful AI from dangerous AI. And it's a leadership skill, not a technical one. You've spent your career knowing when to trust an answer and when to dig deeper. Apply that here.</p>

                    <p>Take something you asked AI for recently. Don't just read the answer — have a conversation with it. Ask follow-up questions. Challenge its assumptions. Check one fact. Get in the habit of dialogue, not just query.</p>

                <h2>Bring your team with you — not just yourself</h2>

                <p>Learning AI isn't a personal project. It's a leadership responsibility. Once you've got the basics, start sharing — not by mandating training, but by modelling the behaviour.</p>

                    <p>Your team is watching what you do, not what you say. If you're still delegating AI to "digital" or waiting for the enterprise solution, they'll do the same.</p>

                    <p>The civil service "One Big Thing" programme is asking all staff to complete AI learning by February 2026. But workshops create awareness, not capability. Real skill comes from practice in context, timely feedback, and repetition.</p>

                    <p>Create permission to experiment. Share prompts that worked. Ask what your team has tried. Make it safe to fail. The organisations pulling ahead aren't the ones with the best AI strategy documents — they're the ones where leaders are visibly learning.</p>

                    <p>This also means being responsive. Governance matters, but so does speed. If your team needs six months of approvals to try a new tool, you've already lost ground to departments that moved faster.</p>

                    <p>The organisations pulling ahead aren't the ones with the best AI strategy documents. They're the ones where leaders are visibly learning, visibly using the tools, and visibly improving. Deloitte found that 85% of organisations increased AI investment in 2025 — but most employees still aren't using what's available.</p>

                    <p>Create permission to experiment. Share prompts that worked. Run a 10-minute show-and-tell. Make it safe to fail. The productivity gains don't come from buying tools — they come from people actually using them, repeatedly, on real work.</p>

                    <p>Build this into how you hire, too. The next generation of leaders will have grown up with AI. If your culture is sceptical or slow, you'll lose them.</p>

                    <p>Your early team will set the culture for everyone who follows. If AI is baked into how you work from day one, it scales. If it's an afterthought, it stays one.</p>

                    <p>Founders using AI well aren't just faster — they're building leaner. One person can now do what used to take a team. Lovable, a Swedish company, built a billion-pound business with fewer than ten people. The same economics apply to you.</p>

                    <p>But this only works if your team learns with you. Share prompts. Review outputs together. Build a library of what works. Make AI fluency part of your hiring criteria — not as a technical skill, but as a way of thinking.</p>

                    <p>Be responsive to what's changing. The tools you use today may be obsolete in six months. The habit of learning won't be.</p>
